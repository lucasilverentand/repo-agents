## Quick Example

Create an issue triage agent in simple markdown:

```markdown
---
name: Issue Triage
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  issues: write
outputs:
  add-comment: { max: 1 }
  add-label: true
---

# Issue Triage Agent

Analyze new issues and:

1. Categorize with appropriate labels (bug, feature, documentation, question)
2. Assess priority (high, medium, low)
3. Welcome the contributor with a friendly comment

Be helpful and welcoming!
```

Then compile it to a GitHub Actions workflow:

```bash
gh claude compile --all
```

## Why gh-claude?

- **Simpler than YAML**: Write instructions in natural language
- **Powerful automation**: Let Claude handle complex decision-making
- **Safe by design**: Explicit permissions and validated outputs
- **Easy to maintain**: Update agent behavior by editing markdown files
