This guide will walk you through creating your first AI-powered GitHub Actions workflow using Repo Agents. By the end, you'll have an agent that automatically triages new issues by adding labels and posting a welcome comment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

    <LinkCard title="Repo Agents extension" description="Follow the installation guide to set up Repo Agents" href="/getting-started/installation" />
</CardGrid>

## Create your first agent

<Steps>

1.  ### Initialize your repository

    Navigate to your repository and run:

    ```bash
    repo-agents init
    ```

    This creates the `.github/agents/` directory with example agent definitions:

    <FileTree>
    - .github/
      - agents/
        - issue-triage.md Example issue triage agent
        - pr-review.md Example PR review agent
        - discussion-moderation.md Example discussion moderator
    </FileTree>

2.  ### Configure authentication

    Set up your Claude API authentication:

    ```bash
    repo-agents setup-token
    ```

    This will guide you through:
    - Choosing between API key or OAuth token
    - Setting the secret at organization or repository level
    - Verifying the configuration

    :::tip[Optional: GitHub App setup]
    For branded identity (comments/commits appear as your app) and CI trigger support, also run:
    ```bash
    repo-agents setup-app
    ```
    This is optional but recommended for production use.
    :::

3.  ### Customize your agent

    Open `.github/agents/issue-triage.md` and customize it:

    ```markdown
    ---
    name: Issue Triage
    on:
      issues:
        types: [opened]
    permissions:
      issues: write
    outputs:
      add-comment: { max: 1 }
      add-label: true
    ---

    # Issue Triage Agent

    Analyze new issues and:

    1. Categorize with appropriate labels (bug, feature, documentation, question)
    2. Assess priority (high, medium, low)
    3. Welcome the contributor with a friendly comment

    Be helpful and welcoming!
    ```

    The YAML frontmatter defines:
    - **name**: Agent identifier
    - **on**: GitHub events that trigger the agent
    - **permissions**: GitHub API access
    - **outputs**: Actions the AI can perform

    The markdown body contains natural language instructions for the AI.

4.  ### Compile to workflows

    Generate GitHub Actions workflows from your agent definitions:

    ```bash
    repo-agents compile
    ```

    This creates:
    - `.github/workflows/agent-dispatcher.yml` - Central dispatcher for all agents
    - `.github/workflows/agent-issue-triage.yml` - Your issue triage workflow

    :::note[What's the dispatcher?]
    The dispatcher is a centralized workflow that:
    - Aggregates all triggers from your agents
    - Validates configuration and permissions
    - Routes events to the appropriate agent workflows
    - Provides self-healing capabilities if misconfigured
    :::

5.  ### Commit and deploy

    Commit the generated workflows and push to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git add .github/
    git commit -m "Add issue triage agent"
    git push
    ```

    Your agent is now live!

6.  ### Test your agent

    Create a new issue in your repository. Within moments, the agent should:
    - Analyze the issue content
    - Add appropriate labels
    - Post a welcoming comment

    Monitor the execution in the **Actions** tab to see detailed logs and metrics.

</Steps>

## What you've learned

You now have a working agent that:
- Triggers automatically on new issues
- Uses AI to analyze and categorize content
- Performs actions within defined constraints
- Runs as a native GitHub Actions workflow
