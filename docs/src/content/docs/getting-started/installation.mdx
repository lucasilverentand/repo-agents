## Prerequisites

Before installing Repo Agents, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 20.0.0 or higher**
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- An **Anthropic API key** for Claude

## Installing

Install Repo Agents via npm or bun:

```bash
npm install -g repo-agents
# or
bun install -g repo-agents
```

## Verify Installation

Check that the extension is installed:

```bash
repo-agents --version
```

You should see the version number displayed.

## Authentication

Configure Claude API access:

```bash
repo-agents setup-token
```

This guides you through adding your Anthropic API key as a repository secret.
