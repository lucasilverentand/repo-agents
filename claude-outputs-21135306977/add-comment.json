To help us implement the right solution, could you please provide some additional details?\n\n**Missing information:**\n- **Which contact form?** Please specify the page or component where this form is located\n- **Reproduction steps:** How can we access and test this form?\n- **Phone number format requirements:** What format should be considered valid? (e.g., US format with area code, international formats, specific pattern like (XXX) XXX-XXXX)\n- **Current behavior:** What happens when an invalid phone number is submitted? Does the form accept it without any error?\n- **Expected behavior:** Should there be client-side validation, server-side validation, or both?\n- **Examples:** Can you provide examples of invalid inputs that should be rejected?\n\nOnce you've added this information, we'll be able to triage and prioritize this issue effectively."
